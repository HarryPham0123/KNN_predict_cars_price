# KNN model to predict cars price
In this project, I've learned the following things:
- K-nearest neighbors algorithm
- Determine the **best features** for training by comparing rmse (root-mean-square-error) of set of numeric columns
- Perform **Hyperparameter optimization** for figure out the most efficient value K-neighbor
- Apply **K-fold cross-validation** to discover the posible best way to devide data for training and testing

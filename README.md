# KNN model to predict cars price
### Project summary:
- By using KNN model and car dataset, we pridict the *price* of a car depending on their numeric features
- we've already update KNN model by discovering the best possible K_neighbor value, training features and dataset separation (train and test set)
- Link data set: [Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)

### In this project, I've learned the following things:
- K-nearest neighbors algorithm
- Determine the **best features** for training by comparing rmse (root-mean-square-error) of set of numeric columns
- Perform **Hyperparameter optimization** for figure out the most efficient value K-neighbor
- Apply **K-fold cross-validation** to discover the posible best way to divide a set of data to 2 separate parts (training part and testing part)
